WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net cpu/opB_mux_sel is sourced
   by a combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE pin to
   control the loading of data into the flip-flop.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:2410 - This design is using one or more 9K Block RAMs
   (RAMB8BWER).  9K Block RAM initialization data, both user defined and
   default, may be incorrect and should not be used.  For more information,
   please reference Xilinx Answer Record 39999.

    Number used as Memory:                       0 out of   1,200    0%
    Number used exclusively as route-thrus:      7
      Number with same-slice register load:      1
      Number with same-slice carry load:         5
      Number with other load:                    1

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                   576 out of     600   96%
  Number of MUXCYs used:                       280 out of   1,200   23%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:        2,123
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:         1,099 out of   2,123   51%
    Number with an unused LUT:                  58 out of   2,123    2%

    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:             137 out of   4,800    2%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
